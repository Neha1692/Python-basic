What is Python, and why is it popular?\n","\n","Ans- Python is a general-purpose programming language that is popular because it is easy to learn, versatile, and has a large community of users.\n","2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n","\n","Ans- A Python interpreter is a computer program that reads and executes Python code line by line\n","3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n","\n","Ans-A keyword refers to a predefined word that python reserves for working programs that have a specific meaning\n","4.  Can keywords be used as variable names?\n","\n","Ans- No, Keywords cannot be used as variable names.\n","5. What is mutability in Python?\n","\n","Ans- In Python, mutability refers to the ability of an object to change after it has been created.\n","6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n","\n","Ans- Tuples use parentheses instead of square brackets, and the items in tuples cannot be modified. We often call lists mutable  and tuples immutable.\n","7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n","\n","Ans- The main difference between the == and is operators in Python is that == compares the equality of objects, while is compares the identity of objects.\n","8. What are logical operators in Python?\n","\n","Ans- Logical operators in Python are keywords that evaluate conditions in a program to return a Boolean value. They are used in conditional statements and expressions to create complex decision-making processes.\n","9. What is type casting in Python?\n","\n","Ans-The process of changing a variable's data type from one type to another.\n","10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n","\n","Ans- Implicit type casting is automatic, while explicit type casting requires the programmer to specify the desired type.\n","11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n","\n","Ans- The purpose of conditional statements in Python is to control the flow of a program by making decisions based on certain conditions.\n","12.  How does the elif statement work?\n","\n","`Ans- Elif is short for \"else if\" and is used when the first if statement isn't true, but you want to check for another condition.\n","13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n","\n","Ans- \"For\" loop is used for iterating over a sequence of elements, while \"while\" loop is used for executing code until a specified condition becomes false.\n","14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n","\n","Ans- 'While' loop is ideal for situations where the number of iterations is not predetermined and depends on some dynamic condition."],"metadata":{"id":"c7KLYF1ZZ6zo"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Write a Python program to print \"Hello,
